# Async iterator

Async iterators provides an elegant method to iterate over each parsed records with the usage of the [`for await...of` construct](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of).

CSV parse rely on and leverages the Node.js stream readable API. It implements the [Symbol.asyncIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator) or [Symbol.iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator) iterable protocol.

This is kind of an obscure JS functionality and we don't have to deal with it. The end result is very comprehensive and illustrated with the [async iterator example](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/blob/master/packages/csv-parse/samples/recipe.async.iterator.js)

This example is available with the command `node samples/recipe.async.iterator.js`.

Async iteration is also supported in CoffeeScript. It is expressed with the [`for...from`](https://coffeescript.org/#generators) syntax available since version 1.12.0. The [async example in coffeescript](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/blob/master/packages/csv-parse/samples/recipe.async.iterator.coffee) is:
